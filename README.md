The assignment was to recreate the new user form on mint.com (which is praised for its design). This was my first true dive into the power of flexbox, and my first true attempt at making a form. I'll admit, this one is pretty damn believable. 

Written with CSS and HTML. 

Completed as a part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a> curriculum.
